I have successfully cleaned up the obsolete and unused code.

**Changes:**
1.  **Removed Unused Modules:**
    *   `src/foundation/event` (Event System) - Replaced by UI events.
    *   `src/foundation/memory/buffer` (Dynamic Array) - Replaced by Arena/Pool.
    *   `src/engine/graphics/backend/render_context.h` - Unused.
    *   `src/foundation/platform/glfw_platform.h` - Redundant.

2.  **Cleaned Up Code:**
    *   Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to remove dead targets and dependencies.
    *   Removed `simple_yaml.c` from `feature_math_engine` (it was unused there).
    *   Removed commented-out debug code and legacy blocks in `render_system.c`, `vk_context.c`, and `vk_swapchain.c`.
    *   Replaced some ad-hoc `printf` calls with the `LOG` macro.

3.  **Documentation:**
    *   Updated `docs/roadmap.md` to mark "Unused Code Removal" as complete.

**Verification:**
*   Rebuilt the project (Debug x64 Linux).
*   Verified the application runs correctly.

**Next Steps (Roadmap Phase 4.5):**
According to the roadmap and my investigation, the next logical steps are:
1.  **String Hashing (StringID):** Replace runtime `strcmp` with Hash IDs for performance and strictness (Command System, UI Bindings).
2.  **Strict Type Safety:** Enforce type checking in Data Bindings.
3.  **Layer System:** Implement `UI_LAYOUT_OVERLAY` for popups/dropdowns.
4.  **Refactor `main.c`:** Move application logic to `EditorLayer`.

Which would you like to tackle next?
